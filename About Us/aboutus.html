            Welcome to Bakey's Goods, My name is ... and im the one who runs this blog. <br> I want to thank everyone who had 
            the time to stop to check us out! <br>
            This blog was started in 2023 when i decided share my baking recipes to friends and family
            and had the thought to share it to others not just people i knew personally, and that is how this blog came to be, I do hope
            to get to see you more often in the future!
